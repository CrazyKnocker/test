# _An update for what is to come..._

_Hello!_ You may have noticed that 3 months have passed without any updates to the site. Until now...
This is due to me no longer focusing on the website. I now develop ROBLOX games, and focus on school. This doesn't mean the site is no longer under development but it means fewer updates, and less often updates.
